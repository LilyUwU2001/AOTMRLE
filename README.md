## Lessons Learned

This project taught me how to use the pillow and tkinter libraries, let me polish my rusty Python skills and use them to build a practical, usable project, in this case a small level editor for a 2D game built in Love2D.

The biggest challenge in this project was a whole new GUI library to learn, tkinter, which I managed to do pretty quickly, in a span of 2 full days, with awesome programming tutorials from tutorialspoint ([https://www.tutorialspoint.com/](tutorialspoint.com))

I also learned how to create my own simple tile-based map format for a 2D platforming game and then parse it in the game.
